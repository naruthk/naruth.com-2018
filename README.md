# Source Code for naruthk.com

Thanks for checking out the source code of my website.

Here are some information about how this website came to be:

- **Architecture:** The site is built using **Gatsby.js** on top of **React** framework. I love the single-page application approach. It's fast, easy to render, and fun to code.
- **Modification**: The theme that I have been using is a modified version of **Lumen**, one of Gatsby's starter themes.

---

### To-Do(s)

- [ ] Integrate **Paper.js** to my homepage
- [ ] Remove unused components that came with the Lumen theme
- [ ] More colors
- [ ] Give life (animation) to this website
