Before ending this post, I'd like to encourage all of you to seek for internships. They are extremely helpful for you because you are able to utilize what you learn in school to actually solve real-world problems.

I know that many people feel discouraged because it is very difficult to get accepted for an internship. But never stop trying ðŸ”¥. 

You will succeed!
