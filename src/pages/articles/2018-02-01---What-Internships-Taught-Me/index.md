A little bit of introduction about myself would not hurt, I think ðŸ˜ƒ.

At the time of writing, I am a current senior at the University of Washington's Seattle campus. I am not pursuing a technical degree like any of my friends do. Instead, I am on the trajectory of earning a Bachelor of Arts in Communications with a minor in Informatics. In essence, the reason that I have decided against pursuing a Computer Science is because I am more product-oriented. I find joy working with front-end technology and not dwelling into algorithms to figure out what's fast and what's slow for a new software ðŸ˜ƒ.

But back to what I am going to discuss on this post.

The focus today is to share my experiences as a technical intern across 3 companies that have a different approach to work and development process.
