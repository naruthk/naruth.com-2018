Today I want to share with you my first ever iOS application called **Daily Notes - Distraction-free**.

I also want to give credit to Gregor Cresnar's [modern icons](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/interface-icon-assets). His wonderful work on icons make my application much more awesome and modern.

The application was built on Xcode with Swift 3.


### Download

Download the app now by visiting the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daily-notes-distraction-free/id1299564920)!

You will need iOS 11+ in order to install this application. As of now, the app can run on an iPhone and an iPad.

> Easy and quick to use. I downloaded a different Note Taking app that was such a pain, I deleted it and went back to Post It’s. Finally decided to try another, and saw this one. I just needed empty space to write a quick note and not have to scramble to find paper and pen, and this works perfectly!!! Write what you want, has edit button, and when finished, just click the check on the top right of the page. Easy!!! Love it.
