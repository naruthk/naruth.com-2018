Today, Apple announced all sorts of new products: the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, the iPhone XR and also the Apple Watch Series 4. These new technologies put Apple back in the spotlight as being a forward-thinking company capable of producing top products for the world to witness and their consumers to use.

Here is a quick run down of what I thought was very interesting from today’s event.

### Apple Watch Series 4

The all-new watch from Apple now has a new design with more room for the screen and less space around the border. That means the new Apple Watch Series 4 has a larger display than any previous models.
The watch also allows the wearer to customize the watch face. Users can now include things like scoreboards from popular sport apps and also health metric and analysis. They can view all of these items straight from the watch face.
The watch is powered by the new S4 chip that features an improved accelerometer, gyroscope, and altimeter. The chip enables the watch to be able to detect falls. So if you accidentally fell down to the ground, your Apple Watch will be able to detect this. And thanks to the improve SOS emergency service, when you fall and remain idle for too long, the SOS emergency service system will automatically be activated.
Another cool feature is the watch’s ability to conduct an electrocardiogram. Apple mentioned that the feature is the first of its kind, especially considering that usually you’ll have to visit a clinic or a hospital to run an electrocardiogram. The technology has been approved by the FDA. But this technology will be available for us later this year.
The watch comes in three types of aluminum finishes: silver, gold, and space gray. The price starts at $399 for the non-cellular model. The $499 model comes with cellular technology.

### iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max

The iPhone XS and XS Max both contains the Super Retina Display with OLED display technology. The iPhone XS has a 5.8-inch screen while the bigger model, the iPhone XS Max, has a 6.5-inch screen.

For those who love taking photos, you’ll love the Smart HDR feature in the Camera app. When editing your photos, you can use the all-new Depth of Field technology to blur the background to your liking.
The brain of new iPhone models is the latest and most advanced A12 Bionic chip. The new chip enables these iPhones to run up to 30% faster while consuming less battery (30 minutes longer than the iPhone X).
If you’re inspired by machine learning, the A12 Bionic chip allows technologies like CoreML and ARKit 2 to become even better. CoreML now runs up to 9 times faster and ARKit 2 enhances how well objects can be detected.
Dual-sim lovers will love the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max. These phones will now have what’s called DSDS or Dual Sim Dual Standby technology. Coupled with eSIM Technology, your new iPhone can carry two different phone numbers at once. 
Both models offer a 64-GB version, 256-GB version, and a 512-GB version.
The 64-GB version starts at $999, while the 256-GB jumps up to $1149.

### iPhone XR

This is an interesting one to think about in my opinion. It sits somewhere between the iPhone X and the iPhone 8 Plus in terms of screen size, capabilities, and price.

The iPhone XR has a 6.1-inch screen size. It features a Liquid Retina and uses LCD technology rather than the OLED version that the iPhone X or the newer models use. The 6.1-inch screen size means that it is actually bigger than the iPhone X or even the iPhone 8 Plus’s screen size.
If you love 3D Touch capability, you’ll be disappointed because the iPhone XR does not support it. 
And rather than having a Dual Len12MP wide-angle camera, the iPhone XR only has a single lens.
In terms of battery life, Apple mentioned that the iPhone XR should last about 1.5 hours longer than the iPhone 8 Plus.
If you’re looking to buy the iPhone XR, you can select from 6 finishes with colors like blue, red, white, black, and lots more to choose from. 
The price starts at just $749.
