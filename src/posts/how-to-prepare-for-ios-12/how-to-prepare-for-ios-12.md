Tomorrow (September 12) is Apple Special Event and the day in which the giant tech company will let us know when the release date for iOS 12 will be. iOS 12 will be the latest operating system that runs on your iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch.

iOS 12 is packed with lots of exciting and cool features. You can now control how notifications appear with the ability to group messages from the same app into a single listing. You can also now set up videos call with up to 32 people at once on FaceTime! iOS 12 comes with performance boost, allowing you to launch apps much faster than its previous operating system, iOS 11, can do.

But like installation any new major software, you should get ready by preparing your device for the big update.

## Check device compatibility

Despite carrying many new features and performance upgrades, iOS 12 will work with any devices that can run on iOS 11. That means the following devices can upgrade and run iOS 12 when it is available:

- iPhone 5s and newer
- iPad Pro devices
- iPad 5th generation and newer
- iPad mini 2 and newer
- iPad Air and newer
- iPod touch 6th generation and newer
  
## Have enough space to install iOS 12

For an installation to take place, your device should have enough storage space. When iOS 12 drops, you’ll probably need more than a few gigabytes (GB) to ensure the installation can be performed.

Do you have apps that you may not need anymore? You may consider temporarily “offloading” the app. What this does is you can offload the app and free up storage that is used by the app. However, you can feel comfortable knowing that the documents and data from the app will still be retrievable. When you reinstall the app, your data will still be available.

To do so, simply go to `General` -> `iPhone Storage`. There you can tap on any application you want to remove and select Offload App.

## Make sure apps are updated

At this point, any major apps on your iPhone will probably be ready when iOS 12 comes out for the public to download and install. That means that if you haven’t yet updated some apps you’ve downloaded from the App Store, then it is recommended that you go ahead and start updating them.

In general, you should always update any of your apps to the latest version to ensure that any critical bug and security flaws within the app will be addressed and fixed.

Remember that in order for many of your apps to work on iOS 12, they’ll have to be updated anyway.

## Back up your devices

It’s always important to back up the content on your devices. With iCloud, you can easily back up your data to the cloud and easily retrieve them when you have access to the Internet.

In case some of you still remember how back up works before iCloud was introduced, we would have to use iTunes to do so. Surprisingly enough, it is still recommended to manually back up your device to iTunes. Having an iTune backup version of your device allows you to easily recover data in your device if you can’t, for instance, find Internet connection to access iCloud.

But whichever method you choose to go with does not matter as long as you do back up your data.

## Now wait for iOS 12 to come out

You’ve done everything necessary to ensure you can comfortably sit back and relax when your device is being upgraded to iOS 12.

Now it’s time for you to wait for the day Apple officially releases iOS 12 to the public.

To update to iOS 12, go to `Setting` -> `General` -> `Software Update`.
