I applied for the position of a Teaching Assistant to teach mobile development two quarters ago, which was around December 2017 if I am right. My expected graduation date was June 2018, so I was hoping that at the very least I could find an academic job to do in my last quarter at the University of Washington. I felt it was an important time in my academic journey to somehow give something back to the university and that was in the form of teaching.

Sometimes around February of 2018, I received an offer letter from the Informatics Department for the position of a Teaching Assistant for Informatics 448: Android Development course. The start date was set to mid of March when spring quarter opened.

Today I reflect back on my experience as an Informatics (iSchool) Teaching Assistant.

### Gaining access to resources in the department

I got plenty of access to resources that were offered to professors, lecturers, staffs, and other teaching assistants. From what I could recall, I was allowed unlimited access to technologies areas and equipment in the iSchool department. Yes, that meant all the cool Macs machines they had, printing materials, and restricted areas in the Mary Gates Hall for iSchool staff.

Another benefit from the department was that I got access to hosting my website on an employee-only server. In general, UW students could sign up for a free hosting space on the students.washington.edu/your_netid_ domain. But as an employee, I was granted access to the employee-only server. I thought that was pretty cool, although I did not find much use for resource anyway since I bought my own domain name ([naruthk.com](naruthk.com)) and host my content elsewhere.

I also got to manage the course content on Canvas website. I was always curious about how the course page on Canvas would look like when you logged in as a TA or the professor. Now that I was one, I was able to modify the course homepage, create new assignments and quizzes, and post new announcements straight from the Instructor View on Canvas. But not all TAs would be a big nerdy like I am about this, but it was something cool for me.

### Improving public speaking skills

To be honest, I was very nervous on my first day leading a lab section. I mean, really, who wouldn’t be? Like any other student, I would come to class, sit in, listen to my professor or TA speak, and be done. It was almost a simple routine. In some classes, I don’t even have to speak out a word during lecture or section, and the quarter would soon be over anyway.

But things were obviously a lot different when _I was the TA_. I had to lead class from day one and onward. I had to speak in front of a large crowd of students. Some of them would constantly make eye contact with you as they listened in on a topic I was presenting. Others might be distracted by what’s on their phone or on their laptop screen.

There was this sense of duty that I had to make sure they could engage with me. So I realized I had to up my public speaking skill. I had to be sure that students would want to come to section each week and be as excited as I was. I discovered that one of the factors to presenting well was to be excited and energetic to the audience. If the students had fun listening to what I had to say, then the level of participation from everybody would increase dramatically. They became engaged and the whole lecture would go by very fast.

I hated the typical section format of coming to lecture, listen to the TA speak for 30 minutes, then form a group discussion to work with your classmates, and everybody would leave when class time was over. I thought that was actually pretty boring considering that in a typical quarter, there were well over 9 weeks of lectures and sections combined.

So I tried things a little differently. I designed each section to be formatted a little differently each time. In the first lab section, I opened the floor for students to get to know me and other classmates better. The first week was very important in my opinion because students would make friends with new folks in class. 

Knowing that everybody would now feel a bit more comfortable after speaking with other people in class, I switched the second week of section to a more “code-along-together” and “ask-me-at-any-moment” format. The goal was to encourage students to openly speak up and facilitate in the classroom discussion. 

When more students spoke up, the ones who were shy would typically feel more comfortable and would eventually be more willing to speak up at some point.

But how does designing each section differently had anything to do with public speaking? Well, it does. If we consider how I format each lecture, you’ll notice that the only way to keep students engage to is to ensure that they can share your passion, excitement, and way of teaching. If they can connect with you, feel fun when they hear you talk, then they’ll participate and be willing to speak up when I ask them too.

That all comes down to public speaking and the ability to do so! 

### Becoming a mentor

I never really understood how powerful mentorship could be until I became a mentor. As a teaching assistant, I had helped so many students to overcome struggles. Maybe it was a question from the assignment that a student could not understand. In other times, a struggle was how to cope with so many assignments and quizzes in the course. One student in the class also asked me for advice on how to become a better developer.

In one special case, some students asked me to become their mentors. At first, I did not know really know how to be a mentor. I was mentored by other people, yes, like my professor who I worked under. But being a mentor had a different feeling to it. I felt like I was not qualified or have enough experience to mentor others.

But I tried it anyway. And it proved to be a success both for me as a mentor and for others as my mentees. Here’s one case story. There was one student in class who struggled because he did not know much about Android development. He never landed any single technical internship before, although he had taken the introductory programming courses being offered at the university. He contacted me ever since day one because he knew he would struggle badly down the road.

I immediately told him that I would be willing to help him as much as I could over the course of 10 weeks. In fact, I promised him that he would finish the course ready to apply to any technical internships out there if he wanted to. I wasn’t wrong to promise him that. The boy ended up landing an actual internship at a rising startup in Seattle.

I did not write this to boast and be praised for my achievement. I was conveying the fact that one can easily be a mentor if he or she puts in an effort to help others in need. As a teaching assistant and a senior at the university, I might have more experience than he did overall, but he trusted me and believed that I could help him. And I equally believed that I could do the same for him.

While I was mentoring him, he would ask me lots of questions — many of which I even struggled to find answers for. So I ended up digging up online and combined what I knew before with what I got from the Internet. I freed up some of my own time to meet up with him and guide him into answering his own question. I wanted him to think like a developer so that he could become one and be good at it. I taught him how to debug the app so that he could learn how to locate where the bug might be or how to look up online to search for help.

I was proud to see him succeed both in class and in life. And I felt very happy being able to mentor others and to see them succeed too.

### Networking

I made lots of friends as a teaching assistant. I kept in touch with lots of my students and also my professor who I worked under. The professor also introduced me to many new individuals in the Informatics department (many were professors) and also from setting a conversation up via email with developers from many companies.

Through networking, I was able to increase my profile and improve my online presence. I got referrals for many tech companies in the United States thanks to the connections that I had with many people in the industry.

I wasn’t as lucky as other friends of mine who were working as a teaching assistant for the introductory programming courses in the Computer Science Department. These courses generally had at least 10 TAs working. That meant these 10 TAs were always having meetings together and became friends. Some of these TAs — maybe all — soon ended up landing jobs at big tech companies, and they were able to help each other improve the chance of getting accepted for interviews.

That is why I think networking is so useful and important in all aspect of our lives. Whether seeking a job or finding someone who is an expert at something, it is always easy to reach out to someone you know in your network.

### Leadership skill

Aside from public speaking skill, I also improved my leadership skill. Each week of lab I had to lead a class of 30 students. It never occurred to me that things would be so different now that I was standing in front of the podium.

Here’s one memorable moment about leadership. On day one of lab section, students came to class pretty early probably hoping to grab the best viewing spot in the classroom. Once they sat down and felt comfortable, they started staring at me and the area of the class perhaps trying to get a feel of how the lab section would be like for the rest of the quarter. When the clock hit 3:30 pm, lab section began. But the only person to lead class was nobody else but me. I was the TA, and it was my duty to lead class and facilitate classroom discussion.

It felt strange at first having to lead a class on my own. Usually, I’d be the one sitting down and looking up at the face of a new TA I would have for a course. But it was me at the podium in this case, and it was a new experience for me.

Over time, leading class felt more natural and fun for me. I was much less nervous and more excited. I can’t wait for the next lab section to finally come by in the next week.

And because every section was always going to be different, I had to always be on the lookout in case something went wrong. What if the students were starting to fade out or take naps? What do I have to do in those situations? I found myself always asking these questions initially, but as time progresses, I learned how to handle these situations and how to best prevent them from occurring. 

In some cases, I handled the problem by transitioning from a method of teaching to another. If I find that students were bored to death from me speaking alone, I switched to letting them work with me on an Android app together based on the topics that the professor had taught them so far during lecture. 

By switching methods of teaching, I tried to make sure students can’t predict what would happen during lecture. From the students’ perspective, they would have been bored to death knowing that each section would always be carried out the same way every single week. Who would want to come to such section if it wasn’t for participation points only, for instance? 

So it was up to me to properly lead class in the way that suited them best, and not from my own perspective or preferred style of teaching.
